# personal-reading-log

This helps me keep track of books and academic papers I've read.

## Tracking Academic Papers

Most every academic paper someone will read SHOULD have a nice BibTeX citation block. I prefer to enter those (with additional tagging and notes and datestamps when something is read) in a JabRef database.

You can get JabRef at FOSSHub (https://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html) or through your package manager, such as apt-get, if you're on a Linux distribution.
