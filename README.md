This helps me keep track of books and academic papers I've read.

## Tracking Academic Papers

Most every academic paper someone will read SHOULD have a nice BibTeX citation block. I prefer to enter those (with additional tagging and notes, more on that in a second) in a `.bib` database. I typically copy the BibTeX reference directly into the database (or import through a nice BibTeX manager), and add two extra fields at the end:

```
    Owner = {wspies},
    Timestamp = {YYYY.MM.DD}
```

My name goes in the __Owner__ field (admittedly a bit redundant here), and the date in YYYY.MM.DD format goes in the __Timestamp__ field. I occasionally add subject-matter tags, or tags that make it quickly for me to find concepts or ideas in the papers that may be relevant to other areas of interest, to the log entries.

Personally, I like to use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) when I want to use a nice-looking front-end managment tool.
